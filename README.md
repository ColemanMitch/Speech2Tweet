# Speech2Tweet

#### Speech2Tweet is an Alexa skill written in Node.js that allows a user to dictate their tweets. 

The invocation for the skill is "speech to tweet" (as in "Alexa, open speech to tweet"). Once the skill is invoked, the user can instruct their Echo device what to tweet by uttering the intent "Tweet _____" or "Tweet the following _____" where the underscore is a open-ended user input. The Echo device will then reiterate what the user has prompted it to tweet.
